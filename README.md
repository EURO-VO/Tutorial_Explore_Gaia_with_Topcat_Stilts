# tctuto

This package contains the materials for a
[TOPCAT](http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/)/[STILTS](http://www.starlink.ac.uk/stilts/) tutorial
based on data from ESA's
[Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)) astrometry mission.

It is comprised of LaTeX source code and a makefile that builds
a PDF document.  The document is intended to be printed out
(in colour) or viewed online, so students can follow the instructions
and see how to use TOPCAT to do scientifically useful things
with astronomy data.

See comments in the `makefile` for how to use this to build the PDF file
or the corresponding local data.

This tutorial was originally developed (in various versions)
for the series of VO-Schools run by the EU-funded ASTERICS project.

Anybody is allowed to use or adapt this content in any way they like.
